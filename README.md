## Vue/Nuxt Frontend Test
Thanks for applying for our Frontend position here at Pinzak. We have prepared this rather simple test to have an idea of your current ability and see how you choose to structure code.

### Objective
The objective of this task is to do an API call and filter and sort its results. This must be done in either Vue.js or Nuxt.js.

### Endpoint
https://fakestoreapi.com/products

### Tasks
1. Create an index page that essentially lists all the products returned by the API.
2. Create a "/product/{id}" page that shows the information of a specific card.
3. Try to replicate the provided design as close as possible.
4. Implement 1 filter: Price range (from X price to Y price)
5. Implement sorting: by price and by name
