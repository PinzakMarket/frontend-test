## Vue/Nuxt Frontend Test
Thanks for applying for our Frontend position here at Pinzak. We have prepared this rather simple test to have an idea of your current ability and see how you choose to structure code.

### Objective
The objective of this task is to do an API call and filter and sort its results. This must be done in either Vue.js or Nuxt.js.

### Endpoint
https://fakestoreapi.com/products

### Tasks
1. Create an index page that essentially lists all the products returned by the API.
2. Create a "/product/{id}" page that shows the information of a specific card.
3. Try to replicate the provided design as close as possible.
4. Implement 1 filter: Price range (from X price to Y price)
5. Implement sorting: by price and by name

### Suggestions
1. Component-irize everything you can/makes sense.
2. Right clean code and complement it with comments if needed.
3. Use axios for API calls.
4. Commit often for us to be able to follow your thought process.

### Design
The design will be provided alongside the email with this challenge.

## Others
Once you are done, push it to your own repository and share the link in the mail provided with this challenge.
